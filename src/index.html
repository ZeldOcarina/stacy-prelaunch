        <p class="section__text">
          Like ocean waves can create mountains, people united can become a true
          force. You might have felt alone during these uncertain times. You are
          not alone. There are still some sparks of a bright future, but only if
          we stand together.
        </p>

        <p class="section__text">
          APG and I have joined forces to help our communities. With our
          combined strength we have been able to provide one million meals to
          the hungry as well as untold support to our communities.
        </p>
        <p class="section__text">
          Nothing can stop us from reaching out and giving back. American Power
          and Gas has provided us with unconditional support. We are happy to be
          working together with this wonderful company.

          <p class="section__text">
            My passion for music led me to become an X factor finalist.
          </p>

          <p class="section__text">
            Many people told me that I wouldn’t be able to achieve my goals. Too
            hard. Too young, too old, too famous, not famous enough. Too white,
            too black. There were a thousand reasons why I couldn’t.
          </p>
          <p class="section__text section__text--right">
            But one thing I learned? You need to empower yourself. No one will
            do it for you.
          </p>
          <p class="section__text section__text--right">
            I made my own path. I believe in persistence. I believe that there
            is power in each one of us. If we stand together no one can defeat
            us. This is not a political game. This is a declaration of freedom
            that everybody deserves. We need to have each other’s back. I now
            ask you and many others to stand with me.
          </p>
          <p class="section__text section__text--right">Together we can make it through anything.</p>
