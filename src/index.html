         <p class="sub-hero-para">
          Like ocean waves can create mountains, people united can become a true force. You might have felt alone during these uncertain times. You are not alone. There are still some sparks of a bright future, but only if we stand together.         </p>

          <p class="sub-hero-para">APG and I have joined forces to help our communities. With our combined strength we have been able to provide one million meals to the hungry as well as untold support to our communities.
          
          
         </p>
         <P class="sub-hero-para">Nothing can stop us from reaching out and giving back. American Power and Gas has provided us with unconditional support. We are happy to be working together with this wonderful company.</P>

        <p class="sub-hero-para">
          My passion for music led me to become an X factor finalist. 
         <p class="sub-hero-para">Many people told me that I wouldn’t be able to achieve my goals. Too hard. Too young, too old, too famous, not famous enough. Too white, too black. There were a thousand reasons why I couldn’t.

         
        </p>
        <p class="sub-hero-para">But one thing I learned? You need to empower yourself. No one will do it for you. </p>
        <p class="sub-hero-para">I made my own path. I believe in persistence. I believe that there is power in each one of us. If we stand together no one can defeat us. This is not a political game. This is a declaration of freedom that everybody deserves.  We need to have each other’s back. I now ask you and many others to stand with me. </p>
        <p class="sub-hero-para">Together we can make it through anything.</p>
