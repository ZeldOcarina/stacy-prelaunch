# APG Benefits Page

This page is coded with SCSS and compiled with webpack.  
The page is hosted live at [https://apg-benefits.now.sh/](https://apg-benefits.now.sh/).  
In order to obtain pure HTML, CSS and Javascript to include it in the existing APG website make sure you build the code by simply running `npm run build`.  
In case you don't have npm installed or don't know what it is I can provide a builded version of the html and css to be included in the APG website.
